| Reference | https://github.com/victor-ibm/birkhoff-cplex-benchmarking |
| Best Objective Value | 3 |
| Optimality Bound | N/A |
| ====== |  |
| Modeling Approach | Integer program that decomoposes a doubly stochastic matrix as the minimum decomposition of $k$ permutation matrices. The program runs for $k=1,2,\dots$ until it finds a solution. The runtime is limited to 1 hour. |
