| Reference | 10.1109/TNET.2021.3088327 https://github.com/vvalls/BirkhoffDecomposition.jl |
| Best Objective Value | 8 |
| Optimality Bound | N/A |
| ====== |  |
| Modeling Approach | First-order convex optimization based on Birkhoff's algorithm. Each iteration of the algorithm computes a permutation matrix and a weight. |
| # Decision Variables | 136 |
| # Binary Variables | 128 |
| # Integer Variables | 8 |
| # Continuous Variables | N/A |
| # Non-Zero Coefficients | 9 |
| Coefficients Type | integer |
| Coefficients Range | [0,1] (permutations), [0,1] (weights) |
| ====== |  |
| Workflow | Each algorithm iteration calls: 1) A linear solver to find a permutation matrix; 2) A linear solver to compute a weight for the permutation matrix selected in step 1 |
| Algorithm Type | Deterministic |
