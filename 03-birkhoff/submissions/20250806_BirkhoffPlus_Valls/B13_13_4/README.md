| Reference | 10.1109/TNET.2021.3088327 https://github.com/vvalls/BirkhoffDecomposition.jl |
| Best Objective Value | 47 |
| Optimality Bound | N/A |
| ====== |  |
| Modeling Approach | First-order convex optimization based on Birkhoff's algorithm. Each iteration of the algorithm computes a permutation matrix and a weight. |
