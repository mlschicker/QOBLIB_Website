# Contributing to QOBLIB

We welcome contributions to the Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library! This guide outlines how to submit solutions and report benchmarking results.

## Submission Process

To contribute a solution to any problem instance, please submit your results via **Pull Request** to this repository. 

Please follow the guidelines below when preparing your submission.

## Validating Your Submission

Before submitting, validate your submission structure and contents using the automated checker tool provided in [misc/check_submission.py](misc/check_submission.py). 
The checker verifies directory structure, CSV format consistency, and can optionally validate solutions. For detailed usage instructions and options, see [misc/README.md](misc/README.md).

## Best Practices

### Solution Files
- Follow the format specified in each problem class directory
- Include validation information when applicable
- Name files according to the instance naming convention

### Documentation
- Be as detailed as possible in your reference material
- Include reproducible instructions
- Document any deviations from standard approaches
- Report negative results (valuable for the community!)

### Stochastic Algorithms
- Run multiple independent trials (recommend 10+ runs, required 5+ runs)
- Report statistical measures (mean, median, std dev) when possible
- Document random seeds for reproducibility

### Runtime Measurements
- Measure wall-clock time for total runtime
- Separate classical and quantum processing times
- Exclude compilation and queue times
- Report hardware specifications completely
